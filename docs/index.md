# #team-cmi5-create-au
## Description
The goal of this team is to create a simple cmi5 package with 1 Assignable Unit (AU) that can be played in the recently launched cmi5 Player that is part of the Project CATAPULT Conformance Test Suite.  

We will try to do this using three 'off the shelf' solutions Storyline, Rise and Acrobat as well as a couple of homebrew approaches.
